Initially it seemed like it wouldn't be so bad, so we talked about ways to use dynamic programing. It feels like recursion is going to be key for this problemset, as there is a recursive graph which exists of all the coin combinations |

I began writing a recursive algorithm to find coin combinations. I know it will have really slow runtime, but I figure that I'll start with something I know I can do then try to optimize it and find time saves. I'm working on the recursive algorithm, but right now it's returning way to many combinations. |
| Jan 27  |  1:20-1:40pm  |                                                                                                                               Uhhhhh. I kind of tuned out discussion around me while I was coding, and just came to a realization that I think everyone had about 20 minutes ago. The reason my algorithm is returning so many possibilities is that it's looking for permutations, meaning there are a LOT of duplicate coin combinations being computed. Also, it will only run on the smallest case, and takes minutes to run any other case. So clearly, the time complexity is HORRIBLE. I'm starting to think of ways to deal with duplicates, but I think I need to deal with them while finding combinations instead of after to save the runtime. |
| Jan 28  | 10:00-10:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                            I had some time to kill between studying for quizzes, so I took another shot at trying to find a way to remove duplicates. I know it'd be much better to stop duplicates from happening immediately. My best idea right now is to almost "hash" each combination, giving it a unique fingerprint which could compare with other combinations in constant time. I also thought of trying some non-dynamic methods, but I know this problemset is meant to teach us about dynamic solutions, and frankly, this problem very clearly builds on itself dynamically. |
| Jan 29  | 10:45-11:15am | This was another thinking class. I was honestly pretty lost in the first 20 minutes. Me and Lucas tried to think of ways to stop duplicate searches in real time by fingerprinting coin combinations, but eventually we caved and asked Mr. Blick for a hint. Instead of searching every coin possibility every step of the way, we'll first shrink the problem down to two coins, and have a path where both coins are used, and a path where only one is used. This structure will recurse until it's found all combinations with these two coins. This saves us because there's no way to double back and use the same coin again and create a duplicate. Then, we'd build a solution using 3 coins from this two coin solution and so on and so forth. |

Worked on implementing a tabulation approach. It's pretty straightforwardâ€”I just use a 2D array as my data structure like we talked about in class, and iterate through the array, using previously tabulated runs to calculate new runs. Got it working in about half an hour. Dynamic programming is really quite simple and elegant. |
